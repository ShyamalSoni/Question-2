# Question-2
Create a weather application which fetches data from open weather APIs. List the temperatures  and  other meta data  for a selected city for the past 14 days. Kee p pagination o n the list  with a limit of 3  and put infinite scroll. 


Ans: I have used WeatherBit Api for getting weather realted information, as for now I am displaying four information (date,temperature,minimum temperature,maximum temperature)

Please Note:

The API which i am using gives me 75 calls for an hour and a single request utilizes 14 calls/request, hence there might be a possiblity that there would be no output for some duration, however it would be workin in an hour or so.
